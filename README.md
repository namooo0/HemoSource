This is a state-wide database/inventory for New York State
The contents of the database will have all blood banks (BB) and hospitals (HOS) in the state
  - Blood (and types)
  - Blood products
  - Time when blood leaves BB/HOS and when it enters
  
This will hopefully accomplish a way for administration to find blood for patients
who are in need of blood

TIme to find blood will go from multiple phone calls (raning ~15-20 min total) to 
a few clicks of the mouse and one phone call

System will incorporate scanning function used to scan blood in and out of BB/HOS
Scan will automatically put information into the database

Administration can search by area and radius and then blood type/product needed
